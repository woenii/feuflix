Brown argues that while technology improves convenience and efficiency, it weakens problem-solving and critical thinking skills. The rise of smartphones, artificial intelligence, and automation has made people more comfortable communicating online rather than in person. This shift reduces face-to-face interaction, impacting social skills and relationships. Brown also highlights privacy risks, as individuals share large amounts of personal data online, increasing the chances of security breaches. Despite these concerns, the article acknowledges technology’s benefits, such as faster communication, improved access to information, and innovation in various fields. The core argument is that people must balance responsible technology use and over-dependence. Logical reasoning and real-world examples support this claim. Brown urges readers to reflect on their own habits and adopt a more cautious approach to technology. The article presents a well-reasoned perspective on the need for mindful usage of digital tools.', response: 'I agree with Terry Brown’s argument that while technology is beneficial, excessive dependence has negative effects. Brown presents strong logical arguments, using realistic examples to support the claim. One key point is that automation and AI reduce the need for problem-solving, making people less capable of thinking critically. The article also effectively explains how reliance on digital communication weakens face-to-face interactions. Privacy concerns are another valid issue, as more personal data is shared online, increasing security risks. However, Brown fairly acknowledges the advantages of technology, ensuring a balanced discussion. The writing is clear, well-structured, and objective, making it easy for readers to engage with the argument. Although the article could have explored solutions for responsible technology use in more depth, it successfully raises awareness about the issue. It encourages readers to reflect on their own habits and consider the long-term effects of their reliance on technology. Overall, Brown’s article is persuasive and thought-provoking.'}">

Tossel, Nathan L. Tehendful, et. al, provides an insightful look into how students perceive the use of such artificial intelligence. In the 21st century, it is known that technology is ever-evolving, and one of those developments has been the creation of robots that are able to answer and make anything that one asks of them, such as art, writing, and even performing the tasks of students themselves. Through the use of surveys, the researchers have asked twenty-four participants various questions regarding the use of this robot in their academic works. The conclusion they received is that the students have a mostly positive view on the tool, however stated that they were distrustful if a robot were to take over in grading their works solely. They’d much rather have the professor grade their output along with the help of ChatGPT instead.', response: 'In general, I’m not fond of ChatGPT and generative AI, as the use of such tools has not been regulated yet. I acknowledge its use and helpfulness as an assistive application, however to fully rely on it constantly is something I do not wish to see becoming more prevalent. It does not help the students to become better writers if they continue to depend on it too much, with their own skills becoming rusty as a robot takes on the work that they should be the one doing. Though, I agree with the participant’s sentiments that I would not trust a robot as well to do the grading, as I would always want it to be done by a professor instead. In the end, despite the article saying that the students found ChatGPT helpful, I still do not like and approve the use of it even so. The purpose of this study is to merely show what the students have thought and answered in the survey, and as it only shows the results, I cannot fault the authors for having this stand or being biased.'}" class="rounded min-w-96 max-h-48 object-cover rounded cursor-pointer">

This shows how the majority of the 24 students used ChatGPT, reflects themselves on how they used it and also the effects of the usage of an AI tool. The results showed that while students see ChatGPT as a potential tool for cheating, their views shifted after using it, in which they recognize their value in learning as they know the right doings rather than the wrong doings. However, most students support the use of ChatGPT as a grading system, since they don’t trust teachers to grade it independently. The study also suggests that Ai can be a valuable tool to use if it\'s used in a correct manner but also requires every human to use their own knowledge and skills to ensure accuracy and fairness. Additionally, it showcases the importance of balancing the usage of technology and the use of personal knowledge and skills.', response: 'According to the article, it provides a well-balanced perspective on how AI impacts the students in the use of its academic task, as it offers both a good benefit but also an issue.

I also appreciate how they do this so that the readers can better understand and know what\'s right. The result of its findings can be shown how AI can enhance the students learning, but not necessarily make the assignments easier but just help them learn and improve. Based on the author, I can see how well it presented in a clear matter, making a strong case for responsible students to use AI tools wisely.

It begins by describing the sudden emergence of generative AI tools and controversy about their impact on learning. The authors conducted a study of 24 participants to collect survey data and observe how student perceptions changed after and before composing a paper using ChatGPT assistance. Rather than making writing easier, the authors discovered that ChatGPT had the effect of making it more complex, requiring students to proofread and revise the AI-created work. Despite this, students reported finding it useful for learning and feeling more comfortable with ChatGPT\'s ethical aspect after use. Concerns still remained about errors and the vague indications of how sure the AI was about its findings. Students also wanted instructors to use ChatGPT to grade, but under human supervision, indicating that they did not completely trust the AI to grade autonomously. These findings indicate that training and \'calibrated trust\' are essential when utilizing AI tools in learning. Ultimately, the authors conclude that ChatGPT should not be regarded as a \'cheating tool,\' but as a partner that can make writing and learning better if used effectively. The study emphasizes that teachers must develop reflective assignments that encourage critical consideration of AI-generated work, as opposed to accepting it at face value.', response: 'I found the study compelling because it highlights ChatGPT as more of an educational tool, rather than just a shortcut to finishing assignments quickly, and that the participants moved from being cynical about ChatGPT to embracing ChatGPT relates to the larger debate about how to integrate AI into learning. Such as the use of ChatGPT with writing processes,  it can be a starting point to help students overcome writer\'s block, can get their ideas flowing, and can definitely lead to better results and deeper learning. I share the authors\' view that while ChatGPT can generate good drafts or ideas, human judgment is required to check for accuracy and relevance. I was also intrigued to see how students asked ChatGPT to assist in grading, but they insisted that a teacher sign off, recognizing that humans are still necessary. This is a good sign for a future where AI augments old ways of teaching and grading rather than displacing them.Meanwhile, I see the fear of students with AI \'hallucinations\' or errors as demonstrating that we need to continue to refine the technology. The findings of the study validate the thesis that learning with AI can make students more active and foster critical thinking. I appreciate how the authors position ChatGPT as a drafting aid rather than something that is diametrically opposed to learning. Reading the study gave me hope that, under proper rules and moral deliberation, AI can augment education. The article in general presents a balanced and realistic perspective, demonstrating how ChatGPT can be a useful learning tool if used judiciously and responsibly.'}" class="rounded min-w-96 max-h-48 object-cover rounded cursor-pointer">
