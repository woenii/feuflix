        "topic": "The advent of AI tools such as ChatGPT has made a huge impact on college life, and students are ambivalent about using it for essay work. Some students adore how ChatGPT assists them in brainstorming ideas, correcting grammar errors, and being less anxious about writing. Others, however, fear that relying too heavily on AI could prevent them from actually learning and thinking for themselves. Several question if it is ethical when some students utilize ChatGPT frequently and others don't, fearing cheating and uneven benefits. Confidence in ChatGPT is divided — while some view it as a useful reference, others are hesitant because it can provide incorrect information or raise privacy concerns. Ultimately, students conclude that though ChatGPT can be helpful, one has to use it cautiously so that learning is assisted without making things unjust.",
        "writers_opinion": "The author believes that ChatGPT can be a good resource for students to utilize when writing but is highly concerned with honesty, learning, and fairness in school. Positively, ChatGPT could facilitate easier writing by assisting students with ideas, structuring thoughts, and preventing grammatical errors. This would be wonderful for students who are not good writers or question whether or not they could write well. The writer is concerned, however, that if students use ChatGPT a lot, they may submit work that is not necessarily their own, which is not ideal for honesty and true learning. Essays are meant to challenge students to think, to argue, and to learn to express their thoughts in words—something they might not be able to practice if they have AI do it all. The writer is also concerned with equality because students using ChatGPT to write most essays might have an unfair advantage over others who try to do the work independently. This could make it harder for teachers to grade fairly and could cause stress among peers. So, the writer can see the benefit of ChatGPT, but thinks that it needs to be done in moderation and not so much so that students are really learning and everyone gets treated fairly.",
        "support": [
            "Some students used ChatGPT to brainstorm and improve grammar, but others feared it might replace critical thinking",
            "Many students questioned how fair it would be for grafing if AI-generated essays were submitted alongside original ones",
            "The study highlighted a lack of trust in AI-generated content, especially regarding accuracy and originality."
